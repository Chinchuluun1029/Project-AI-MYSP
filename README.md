# Project-AI-MYSP
This is the project/introductory to my summer program MYSP. My project focused on AI and its applications. Using HTML, JS and PowerPoint, my team explained and showed the practicality of AI applications.
I have worked on the applications and its presentation by linking the softwares and demo with the website. 

Credits to WaveNet, Speechify, Project Naptha for their usage of text-to-speech and text-audio recognition; Noun Project for icon PNG.
