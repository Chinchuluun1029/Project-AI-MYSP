# Project-AI-MYSP
This is the project/introductory presentation to my summer program MYSP. My project focused on AI and its applications. Using HTML, JS and PowerPoint, my team explained and showed the practicality of AI applications.
I have worked on the applications and its presentation by linking the softwares and demo with the website. index.html contains all the elements of the main page <a href="http://projectai.surge.sh">ProjectAI</a>
