# Project-AI-MYSP
This is the project/introductory presentation for my summer program MYSP. My project focused on AI and its applications. Using HTML, JS and PowerPoint, my team explained and showed the practicality of AI applications.
I have worked on the applications and its presentation by linking the softwares and demo with the website. docs/index.html contains all the elements of the main page <a href="http://projectai.surge.sh">ProjectAI</a>
<div>By using AI applications such as text-to-speech, audio recognition and image recognition, my team aimed to show how narrow artificial intelligence can be used to help the visually impaired to read from texts, books and images through these applications.

Credits to WaveNet, Speechify, Project Naptha for their usage of text-to-speech and text-audio recognition; Noun Project for .PNG icon.
