# Project-AI-MYSP
This is the project/introductory presentation for my summer program MYSP. From gender equality to economics and ethics, MYSP covered many college-level courses in a span of a full week at Nairamdal International Summer Camp. On the final day, students have to present what they have learnt in the past few days. My project focused on AI and its applications. Using HTML, JS and PowerPoint, my team explained and showed the practicality of AI applications from the view of a data scientist. 
I have worked on the applications and its presentation by linking the softwares and demo with the website. The <a href="https://github.com/Chinchuluun1029/Project-AI-MYSP/blob/master/index.html" target="_blank">index</a> contains all the elements of the main page <a href="http://projectai.surge.sh">ProjectAI</a>. The <a href="https://github.com/Chinchuluun1029/Project-AI-MYSP/blob/master/page2.html">second page</a> includes the HTML code for the project itself, including images with texts for demonstration. All HTML, CSS and JS files have been written by me.

<div>On the project tab, the various images containing texts will be processed by Project Naptha and Speechify to be read, edited into audio files using the Stroke Width Transform algorithm. The audio can be made more "human-like" using Wavenet, a deep neural-network finding algorithm.</div>

<div>By using AI applications such as text-to-speech, audio recognition and image recognition, my team aimed to show how narrow artificial intelligence can be used to help the visually impaired to read from texts, books and images through these applications or to simply create audiobooks from text files with the help of artificial intelligence.
